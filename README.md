✔ Data Visualization: Microsoft Power BI was used to create insightful bar charts, pie charts, donut charts, and maps.

✔ Recommendation:
➡️ Strengthen Focus on the Consumer Segment for Higher Revenue Generation:
✅ Since 51.48% of sales come from consumers, personalized marketing campaigns and offers for them could drive even more revenue.

➡️ Expand Market Share in Underperforming Regions:
✅ Africa and Asia Pacific have lower sales percentages. Investing in marketing and logistics in these regions could boost sales.

➡️ Improve Product Profitability:
✅ The Cubify CubeX 3D Printer has the highest loss. Evaluating pricing, supplier costs, or discontinuing low-performing products might be beneficial.

➡️ Maximize High-Profit Products:
✅ Canon imageCLASS 2200 and Cisco Smart Phone, Full Size are the most profitable. Increasing stock, promotions, and marketing for these products can further drive profits.

➡️ Monitor High Returns:
✅ The return count is 1,464. Analyzing reasons for returns (defective products, incorrect shipments, etc.) can help reduce costs and improve customer satisfaction.

✔ Conclusion: This Power BI dashboard offers actionable insights into Amazon’s sales performance, profitability, and regional trends. By leveraging these data-driven recommendations, Amazon can enhance sales 
  strategies, optimize resource allocation, and maximize profitability.
