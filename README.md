1. Project Title:
   Amazon Global Sales Dashboard: Insights with Power BI
   An interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze Amazon’s sales, profitability, and regional performance — helping optimize sales strategies and resource allocation.
       
2. Purpose of the project:
   The objective of this project is to evaluate Amazon’s sales performance across customer segments, regions, and products. By leveraging interactive visualizations, the dashboard uncovers key insights into revenue              generation, profitability, and regional sales distribution.

3. Tech Stack:
   The project was built using the following tools and technologies:
   ✔ Microsoft Power BI – Dashboard design and interactive reporting.
   ✔ Power Query Editor – Data cleaning, transformation, and preparation.
   ✔ DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Measures, KPIs, and calculated fields.
   ✔ Data Source – Amazon sales dataset (2012–2015), including sales, returns, customer, and product-level information.

4. Data Source: CSV dataset (compnay-level data).
   ✔ Dataset fields included: sales, returns, customer names, product IDs, product categories, regions, and delivery dates.
   ✔ Cleaned in Power Query Editor (set headers, created delivery date column, extracted year for trend analysis).
   ✔ Enriched with calculated KPIs for projections, returns, and profitability.
  
5. Features / Highlights:
   ✔ Business Problem: Amazon’s vast sales data makes it difficult to identify which customer segments, regions, or products drive profit and which areas cause losses. A consolidated analytical dashboard provides clarity for      strategic planning.

      To build an interactive sales monitoring tool that:
        ➡ Tracks revenue, profitability, and returns across segments.
        ➡ Identifies the most and least profitable products and customers.
        ➡ Highlights regional sales trends to optimize marketing and logistics.
